# Magic Ball Pitch

[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/TheOdinProject/projects/36/views/1)

## Problem
Users have reported that making decisions is stressful. They are tired of multiple meetings where issues are debated and would like a web app that can make business-critical decisions for them.

## Solution
A toy from the 1950's, the [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball) in would make client meetings a breeze since it would make decisions for them. Our task is to recreate the Magic 8 ball with all the [possible answers from the original toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball#Possible_answers).

The UI should have a button that a user can click that will update the Ball's "window" at the center. And the answer that is revealed should be random.

### Mockup:

## No-gos
- We don't need animations for this version of the toy. The clients need the toy ASAP and don't care about animations.
- No mobile responsiveness needed.
- Accessibility will be addressed in next project cycle.
Since the possible answers are few, we don't need a backend. We can use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
